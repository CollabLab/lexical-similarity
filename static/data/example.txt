A: Hey.
B: Hey.
B: What's up.
A: I broke my necklace... I'm a bit distraught.
B: What necklace?
A: A necklace that my grandma gave me...
B: :(
A: It just seriously snapped in half.
B: The pendant, or the chain?
A: The chain.
B: At least it's just the chain.
B: That can be fixed pretty easily.
A: Hopefully.
A: Anyways.
A: What's up with you?
A: Plans all set and made?
B: For a road trip?
A: Yup?
B: No, Mark had exams yesterday, so we couldn't do a last-minute DC thing.
A: Damn.
B: I know.
B: Then I was gonna get together with Mike tonight, but he's sick.
B: Oh well.
A: Call some other people.
B: It's late, now.
A: 10:30?
A: That's not late!
B: I want to go to an early class tomorrow.
B: My parents are going to Cali for the week.
A: Oooooh.
A: PARTE!
B: Exactly.
B: :p
A: Seriously?
B: You tell me.
A: Ummm... it is your house... will you be throwing a swinging party?
B: Not so much.
A: What does your away message mean?
B: SQL is a database language, and it's pronounced sequel, and since I'm still working on it again, it's, well, the sequel...
A: Ahh... gotcha.
A: Noach.
B: Si.
A: Buon Giorno.
B: Alo!
A: Noach I have swapped 1 vice for another.
A: Not that the old one was really a vice...
B: OK...
A: I am obsessed with Veronica Mars.
B: I am not familiar with the Veronica Mars of which you speak.
A: It is a teenage soap opera.
B: Uh huh...
A: Please... do try to hide your disappointment.
B: I was just nodding.
A: Smiling and nodding?
B: Sure, why not.
B: :p
A: Yeah, pretty bad though isn't it.
B: I'll have to take your word for it.
A: So what is up?
B: Not much...just teaching myself MySQL/PHP/AJAX.
A: I am bored. How are you entertaining yourself?
B: It's pretty intense.
A: Sweet.
B: I'm going to bed.
B: 'night.
A: G'night.
