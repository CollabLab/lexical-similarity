thesonyak: Hey.
noleli: Hey.
noleli: What's up.
thesonyak: I broke my necklace... I'm a bit distraught.
noleli: What necklace?
thesonyak: A necklace that my grandma gave me...
noleli: :(
thesonyak: It just seriously snapped in half.
noleli: The pendant, or the chain?
thesonyak: The chain.
noleli: At least it's just the chain.
noleli: That can be fixed pretty easily.
thesonyak: Hopefully.
thesonyak: Anyways.
thesonyak: What's up with you?
thesonyak: Plans all set and made?
noleli: For a road trip?
thesonyak: Yup?
noleli: No, Mark had exams yesterday, so we couldn't do a last-minute DC thing.
thesonyak: Damn.
noleli: I know.
noleli: Then I was gonna get together with Mike tonight, but he's sick.
noleli: Oh well.
thesonyak: Call some other people.
noleli: It's late, now.
thesonyak: 10:30?
thesonyak: That's not late!
noleli: I want to go to an early class tomorrow.
noleli: My parents are going to Cali for the week.
thesonyak: Oooooh.
thesonyak: PARTE!
noleli: Exactly.
noleli: :p
thesonyak: Seriously?
noleli: You tell me.
thesonyak: Ummm... it is your house... will you be throwing a swinging party?
noleli: Not so much.
thesonyak: What does your away message mean?
noleli: SQL is a database language, and it's pronounced sequel, and since I'm still working on it again, it's, well, the sequel...
thesonyak: Ahh... gotcha.
thesonyak: Noach.
noleli: Si.
thesonyak: Buon Giorno.
noleli: Alo!
thesonyak: Noach I have swapped 1 vice for another.
thesonyak: Not that the old one was really a vice...
noleli: OK...
thesonyak: I am obsessed with Veronica Mars.
noleli: I am not familiar with the Veronica Mars of which you speak.
thesonyak: It is a teenage soap opera.
noleli: Uh huh...
thesonyak: Please... do try to hide your disappointment.
noleli: I was just nodding.
thesonyak: Smiling and nodding?
noleli: Sure, why not.
noleli: :p
thesonyak: Yeah, pretty bad though isn't it.
noleli: I'll have to take your word for it.
thesonyak: So what is up?
noleli: Not much...just teaching myself MySQL/PHP/AJAX.
thesonyak: I am bored. How are you entertaining yourself?
noleli: It's pretty intense.
thesonyak: Sweet.
noleli: I'm going to bed.
noleli: 'night.
thesonyak: G'night.
